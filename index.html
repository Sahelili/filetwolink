<p align="left" style="color:black"><font size="+3">1.What are the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine?</p></font>
<ul align="left" style="color:navy"><font size="+2">
<li>Prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from becoming seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19</li>
<li>Prevent you from spreading the COVID-19 virus to others</li>
<li>Add to the number of people in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19 â€” making it harder for the disease to spread and contributing to herd immunity</li>
<li>Prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading and replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more resistant to vaccines</li>
</ul></font>
<p align="left" style="color:black"><font size="+3">2.Can COVID-19 vaccines affect the heart?</p></font>
<p align="left" style="color:navy"><font size="+2">In the U.S., there has been an increase in reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in male adolescents and young adults age 16 and older. Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle, while pericarditis is the inflammation of the lining outside the heart. These reports are rare. The CDC is investigating to see if there is any relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.

Of the cases reported, the problem happened more often after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and typically within several days after COVID-19 vaccination. Most of the people who received care felt better after receiving medicine and resting. Symptoms to watch for include:</p></font>
<ul align="left" style="color:navy"><font size="+2">
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart</li>
</ul></font>
<p align="left" style="color:navy"><font size="+2">If you or your child has any of these symptoms within a week of getting a COVID-19 vaccine, seek medical care.</p></font>
